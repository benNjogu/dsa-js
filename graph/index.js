/**
 * @graph
 * - Collections of things and there are relationships or connections between them.
 * - The data in the graph are called nodes or vertices.
 * - The connection between the nodes is called edges.
 * - e.g. a social network.
 *
 * There are two major types of graphs
 *      a) Directed graphs
 * - graphs with a direction between nodes.
 * - e.g. internet and web page links.
 *
 *      b) Undirected graphs
 * - graphs without any direction between nodes.
 * - e.g. social network i.e. people and friends.
 *
 * There are a few ways to represent a graph
 *      a) Adjacency list.
 * - This method assiciate each node with a collection of its neighbouring vertices or edges.
 * - can be used to represent an undirected graph
 * - can be represented using an array.
 *
 *      b) Adjacency matrix
 * - A 2d array where each array has the same number of elements as the outer array.
 * - 0 means there is no edge or relationships and 1 means there is a relationship.8
 * - can be used to represent a directed graph
 *
 *      c) Incidence matrix
 * - A 2d array.
 * - uses rows to rep nodes and columns to rep edges.
