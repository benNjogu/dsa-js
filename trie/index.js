/**
 * @Trie
 * a special type of tree used to store associative data structures.
 * it stores data in steps. each step is a node in a trie.
 * it is often used to store words since there are a finite number of letters that can be put together to make a string.
 *
 * can be used to validate that a word is in a dictionary. each step would rep one letter of a word.
